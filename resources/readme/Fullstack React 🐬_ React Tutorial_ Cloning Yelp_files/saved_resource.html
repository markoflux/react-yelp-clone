I had to comment out this import to stop the error.\n\nWhen you create the Rating component here https://www.fullstackreact.com/articles/react-tutorial-cloning-yelp/#rating-component, you don't show replacing the decimal rating with the Rating component. It would be helpful to show that you are replacing \u003cspan>{place.rating/5}\u003c/span> with \u003cRating percentage={place.rating/5} />\n\nThe code shown in https://www.fullstackreact.com/articles/react-tutorial-cloning-yelp/#building-the-main-pane is from the file  'src/views/Main/routes.js', but it's labeled as being from 'src/views/routes.js'\n\nWhen you begin breaking out the routes from Container into Map, your code snippet removes the onRender and google prop. It's only by comparing the code to the github repo that I realized it wasn't to be removed in that step.\n\nIn the code snippets for src/views/Main/Container.js after this section: https://www.fullstackreact.com/articles/react-tutorial-cloning-yelp/#splitting-up-components, your render method is missing either an opening \u003cdiv> tag or a closing \u003c/div> tag.\n\nJust aboe this section: https://www.fullstackreact.com/articles/react-tutorial-cloning-yelp/#inlining-styles, in the code snippet there is an import for 'component/Header', but it should read 'component/Header/Header'. I think there was one other of these mistakes as well.\n\nIn your color definitions for colors.css, you define --light-gray as $a2a2a2 instead of #a2a2a2.\n\nIn the section https://www.fullstackreact.com/articles/react-tutorial-cloning-yelp/#adding-more-details-to-markers, when you add the route to Details, it is not nested in the /map route, so the push call in Container doesn't send the click to the correct place.\n\nWhen applying padding to the Detail view heading, the global variable --padding hasn't been set yet. When looking in the repo, I can see that it's inteded to be 25px, but that should be set ahead of time either when the topbar-color variable is moved into the base.css file, or before you apply the padding variable to the style.\n\nThat's as far as I could get. At this point, clicking on a marker causes a url change, but doesn't route away from the map view. I copied code directly from the final repo and it still doesn't work. I don't know if the issues arose because I had to copy code from the repo and my project isn't far enough along for that code, or if I made a mistake somewhere, but I have to give up. I've been at this too long.\n\nIncidentally, the star ratings are off in both my attempt and the final attempt. I think it has to do with how the styles are applied in the module format. I have never found there to be an issue with globally defined css and I don't understand the desire to make this process more complicated, just my opinion. I've seen it in other builds and I know modularizing the styles is a popular idea, but I see it as adding more issues than it solves.\n\nThis looked like a promising tutorial, I was hoping to get hands on experience writing components and dealing with state prop issues, but instead just wasted an entire day trying to debug my way through the issues in the steps provided.

<p>Something is totally wrong with this world, when tutorial for simple (primitive) 2-views "app" (lol) takes crazy amount of text and non-coding related stuff. I understand that all this enveroinment is important on big project, but it's super confusing when you advertising this guide as some sort of "let's create really cool and complex megathing!" but in the end all what we have is some tiny useless boilerplate, which I was able to create with angular 2 years ago in 30+ minutes without any tutorials about being webpack slave.</p>

<p>Perhaps there's something constructive you could offer instead?</p><p>As someone who has hired over 50 devs, it's amazing how many first-year-out-of-school developers make comments about how they can build an app in 30 minutes. How does that work with your scm? environment? acl? high availability? load testing? unit testing? edge cases?</p><p>Again, from a hiring perspective, I believe a common shortcoming of developers in the marketplace today is a lack of understanding of devops best practices. The people looking at this who are coming from a world of angular, rails, flask, django, php, .NET, etc will see a lot of value in how to properly configure a basic working environment.</p><p>Each and every language and framework has nuances that are unique to the environment and I applaud Ari(don't know him) for including some basic best practices here -- an area that many tutorials simply don't address.</p><p>Ari, thank you for the contributions.</p>

<p>I especially pointed on a fact, that final demo result is very underwhelming, considering this crazy amount of text and setup code. And I mentioned that I understand importance of good environment. They probably needed to name it "part 1" and then focus on creating something cool in part 2, so everybody would see why they invested so much time and efforts in setup of env. Because currently, this tutorial must be very confusing for beginners, which will be just smashing their heads against the wall, fighting setup process, without writing almost any code, which actually does something. Getting results it's one of the most important things in education for beginners.</p>

<p>Cannot agree more. The suggested time for reading the article is between 1-2 hours. <br>Lot of code, loads of new concepts and syntax to learn. This tutorial is huuuge :)<br>As mentioned by Nikolay when you then open the demo the result is underwhelming. Showing master/detail records on top of google maps. Seriously ? What's revolutionary in all of this ? Why should I learn it? <br>I understand that there are jobs to be created and mortgages to be paid but this whole JS frenzy is getting out of control. In the end it's always the same stuff: html + ajax calls to make it "alive".</p><p>JQuery and  Knockout.js  can cover 100% of your needs, go for Angular if you like (it's too much already).<br>This is unnecessary.</p>

<p>This tutorial provides you insights into best practices, a primer on several front end technologies including a good testing framework. It even touches upon a basic responsive layout.</p><p>The title says "Full stack React" and it fulfills that promise. Whether the final result is cool enough is up to debate and thats not the point. Its about how you get there with React. IMO this tut provides a great starting point for anyone starting with React. I am thankful to the author to have taken the time to create an excellent article.</p>

<p>Now, I hugely appreciate the effort that went into this tutorial. It offers great learning opportunities, and is pretty easy to follow along with.</p><p>However.. There are so incredibly many annoying minor mistakes throughout this tutorial. I wish the author went through it - or at least had it peer reviewed - before publishing it.</p>

<p>Any reason you exporting `makeRoutes` as a function and not the actual result? Since it's exported twice would it make sense to change the default export to:</p><p>```<br>export default makeRoutes()<br>```</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>There a few places in this tutorial where following along doesn't produce the results shown.</p><p>When breaking out components into Listing and Item, the Rating component is imported, though we have to wait for the next section before we create it. I had to comment out this import to stop the error.</p><p>When you create the Rating component here <a href="https://www.fullstackreact.com/articles/react-tutorial-cloning-yelp/#rating-component" rel="nofollow">https://www.fullstackreact.com...</a>, you don't show replacing the decimal rating with the Rating component. It would be helpful to show that you are replacing <span>{place.rating/5}</span> with &lt;rating percentage="{place.rating/5}"/&gt;</p><p>The code shown in <a href="https://www.fullstackreact.com/articles/react-tutorial-cloning-yelp/#building-the-main-pane" rel="nofollow">https://www.fullstackreact.com...</a> is from the file  'src/views/Main/routes.js', but it's labeled as being from 'src/views/routes.js'</p><p>When you begin breaking out the routes from Container into Map, your code snippet removes the onRender and google prop. It's only by comparing the code to the github repo that I realized it wasn't to be removed in that step.</p><p>In the code snippets for src/views/Main/Container.js after this section: <a href="https://www.fullstackreact.com/articles/react-tutorial-cloning-yelp/#splitting-up-components" rel="nofollow">https://www.fullstackreact.com...</a>, your render method is missing either an opening &lt;div&gt; tag or a closing &lt;/div&gt; tag.</p><p>Just aboe this section: <a href="https://www.fullstackreact.com/articles/react-tutorial-cloning-yelp/#inlining-styles" rel="nofollow">https://www.fullstackreact.com...</a>, in the code snippet there is an import for 'component/Header', but it should read 'component/Header/Header'. I think there was one other of these mistakes as well.</p><p>In your color definitions for colors.css, you define --light-gray as $a2a2a2 instead of #a2a2a2.</p><p>In the section <a href="https://www.fullstackreact.com/articles/react-tutorial-cloning-yelp/#adding-more-details-to-markers" rel="nofollow">https://www.fullstackreact.com...</a>, when you add the route to Details, it is not nested in the /map route, so the push call in Container doesn't send the click to the correct place.</p><p>When applying padding to the Detail view heading, the global variable --padding hasn't been set yet. When looking in the repo, I can see that it's inteded to be 25px, but that should be set ahead of time either when the topbar-color variable is moved into the base.css file, or before you apply the padding variable to the style.</p><p>That's as far as I could get. At this point, clicking on a marker causes a url change, but doesn't route away from the map view. I copied code directly from the final repo and it still doesn't work. I don't know if the issues arose because I had to copy code from the repo and my project isn't far enough along for that code, or if I made a mistake somewhere, but I have to give up. I've been at this too long.</p><p>Incidentally, the star ratings are off in both my attempt and the final attempt. I think it has to do with how the styles are applied in the module format. I have never found there to be an issue with globally defined css and I don't understand the desire to make this process more complicated, just my opinion. I've seen it in other builds and I know modularizing the styles is a popular idea, but I see it as adding more issues than it solves.</p><p>This looked like a promising tutorial, I was hoping to get hands on experience writing components and dealing with state prop issues, but instead just wasted an entire day trying to debug my way through the issues in the steps provided. I would really like to get to the end if you feel like going through and fixing the issues.</p>

<p>Maybe the name of the guide does not match the actual contents. It has useful information for teams that want to setup a build environment but for someone who is starting with react it's not ideal. It's very easy to get bored after pages of just boilerplate setup.</p><p>Testing is important, and having sophisticated builds is also important, but for learning purposes motivation comes first, and that's lost with too much time spent on build setup.</p>

<p>Hi Ari, Thanks for responding. Have the Ng-book love it. Is there a post that specifically deals with setting up a React/babel/webpack environment? if not that would help immensley. I also seemed to have problems with the initial npm install on babel- that issue might be related to updated versions of React and Babel though</p>

<p>That's a great idea. I'll put that in the queue for the next few posts. The babel/webpack/react build-chain can be a beast. I generally use this setup in most of my posts, although it gets better by a little bit every time.</p><p>Anyway, great suggestion and I'll be sure to write something up in the next few posts.</p>

<p>Hey guys. I bought the book. Along the lines of what Vishal said specifically where you refer to setting up the webpack.config.js file there's not a lot of clarity. I'm getting the same errors. Could you possibly just post what the webpack.config.js should look like at this point in one screenshot because this section is very confusing as currently presented.</p>

<p>Hi Vishal,</p><p>Good to hear it. Indeed, the intermittent step where you run `hjs-dev-server` before inserting it into `package.json` actually requires that you specify `NODE_ENV`. So, that command looks like this:</p><p>$ NODE_ENV=development ./node_modules/.bin/hjs-dev-server</p><p>We'll correct the error in the post.</p><p>Thanks!</p>

After using Conny's modified script everything works fine for windows.

Now after all that's done and you've made sure to update your start script with Conny's above. Run NPM start and you'll be off to the races!</p>
